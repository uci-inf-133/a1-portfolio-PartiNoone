         <p>Radicals: Black and white shapes that invert the text color? On paper? Cool
           to look at, but a pain to do if you had no markers and no 
           white gel pen. You can tell I got sick of it after the first box 
           when I switched to solid white text boxes instead.

           Factoring: This one was much nicer on my hand muscles. Using colored pencils to color in blocks 
           of paper is definitely preferable to using pen to do the same thing.

        <p id="fullscreen">Blueprint: This one started as an assignment for Digital Media class, but it was really
          complicated and it seemed like too much work to recreate the whole thing in
          Adobe Illustrator, so this became its own thing. The drawing I used for 
          the assignment was vaguely similar in aesthetic, so that's why this 
          drawing kind of looks like the second-last image on the Digital Art page.</p>
